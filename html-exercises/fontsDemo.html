    <h1>francis forever - mitski</h1>

    <p>I don't know what to do without you 
        I don't know where to put my hands 
        I've been trying to lay my head down 
        But I'm writing this at 3am
        I don't need the world to see 
        That I've been the best I can be, but 
        I don't think I could stand to be 
        Where you don't see me
        On sunny days I go out walking 
        I end up on a tree-lined street 
        I look up at the gaps of sunlight 
        I miss you more than anything</p>
    <p>I don't need the world to see 
        That I've been the best I can be, but 
        I don't think I could stand to be 
        Where you don't see me
        And autumn comes when you're not yet done 
        With the summer passing by, but 
        I don't think I could stand to be 
        Where you don't see me</p>
